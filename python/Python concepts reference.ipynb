    "Sometimes you create a python file with many functions inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a python file from the command line in the form `python <filename.py>`, the file is identified by python as `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest confusion I had about this concept is how it applies to *source files* and *function defintions*. So now get it straight. This concept applies to the relationship between `*.py` files and the functions and classes inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of making use of the any `*.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By just running the function from the command line\n",
    "1. By importing it when you may need any of the function or classes it contains\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Running a python program inside a jupyter notebook, jupyter sort of simulates how the program is run on the command line. To fully understand what is happening, you may need to export the example code to a python file and then run the examples from command line.\n",
