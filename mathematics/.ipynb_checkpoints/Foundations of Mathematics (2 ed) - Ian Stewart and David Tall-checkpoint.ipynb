    "1. Think how you think about mathematics. If you meet a new problem which fits into a pattern that you recognise, your solution may follow a time-honoured logical course, but if not, then your initial attack may be anything but logical. Try these three problems and do your best to keep track of the steps you take as you move towards a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) John’s father is three times as old as John; in ten years he will only be twice John’s age. How old is John now?\n",
    "    **I jsut do the usual equation thing I got used to in secondary school. By solving the set of equations $f = 3j; f = 2j + 10$**\n",

    "    (b) A flat disc and a sphere of the same diameter are viewed from the same distance, with the plane of the disc at right angles to the line of vision. Which looks larger?\n",
    "    **I try to picture the disk and sphere. In my mind I didn't think either of them will appear larger**\n",
    "\n",
    "    (c) Two hundred soldiers stand in a rectangular array, in ten rows of twenty columns. The tallest man in each row is selected and of these ten, S is the shortest. Likewise the shortest in each column is singled out and T is the tallest of these twenty. Are S and T one and the same? If not, what can be deduced about the relative size of S and T?\n",
    "    **No. S is greater than T\n",
    "    I try to visualize the situation. The tallest man in a row doesn't necessarily have to be the shortest in a column.**\n",

    "2. Consider the two following problems:\n",
    "    (a) Nine square metres of cloth are to be divided equally between five dressmakers; how much cloth does each one get? **They will each get 9/5 meters**\n",
    "    (b) Nine children are available for adoption and are to be divided equally between five couples; how many children are given to each couple?**At least one of the couple will have to settle for one child**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both of these problems translate mathematically into: \"Find $x$ such that $5x = 9$\". Do they have the same solution? How can the mathematical formulation be qualified to distinguish between the two cases? **No. They have different solutions | To distinguish the cases, it has to be stated that the answer to (a) is a real number while the answer to (b) is a natural number**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Suppose that you are trying to explain negative numbers to someone who has not met the concept and you are faced with the comment: \"Negative numbers can’t exist because you can’t have less than nothing.\" How would you reply? **You can't *have* less than nothing but you can *owe* something**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What does it mean to say that a decimal expansion \"recurs\"? What fraction is represented by the decimal 0·333. . .? What about 0·999. . .?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mathematical use of language sometimes differs from colloquial usage. In each of the following statements, record whether you think that they are true or false. Keep them for comparison when you read chapter 6.\n",
    "    (a) All of the numbers 2, 5, 17, 53, 97 are prime. **true in colloquial use. In math, not so much. 'all' implies taken collectively**\n",
    "    (b) Each of the numbers 2, 5, 17, 53, 97 is prime. **true**\n",

    "6. ‘If pigs had wings, they’d fly.’ Is this a logical deduction? **No. Not all things with wings fly**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ‘The set of natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . is infinite.’ Give an explanation of what you think the word ‘infinite’ means in this context. **it means that I can keep counting and never be finished till I'm dead**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A formal definition of the number 4 might be given in the following terms. First note that a set is specified by writing its elements between curly brackets { } and that the set with no elements is denoted by ∅. Then we define\n",
    "$4 = {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}, {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}}$. Can you understand this definition? Do you think that it is suitable for a beginner? **Yes. Not suitable for a beginner**\n",
