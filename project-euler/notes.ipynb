    "$\\sqrt x * \\sqrt x = x$. So if the two factors are the same, they're both the square root. If you make one factor bigger, you have to make the other factor smaller. This means that one of the two will always be less than or equal to $\\sqrt x$, so you only have to search up to that point to find one of the two matching factors. You can then use $\\frac{x}{fac1}$ to get $fac2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finding the nth Prime, from http://www.paul-scott.com/nth-prime.php\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a drawn out process. The best optimisation we can include in this process is found when we consider that each factor has a reciprocal pair. For example, 6n is divided by the pairs (2, 3n) and (3, 2n). The numbers in each pair converge at the square-root of p. Immediately we can reduce the number of checks we need to make by only considering possible factors from 2 to p½.\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing piece of the puzzle is how primes relate to lower primes. If we consider some integer n, we know what we can express n as a product of its factors. Each of those factors (integers themselves) can equally be expressed as a product of their factors, and so we can express n as the product of factors of its immediate factors. At what point does this end? When the factors are prime. Indeed, any non-prime integer can be expressed solely as the product of prime factors. Therefore, if we know all of the primes less than p and none of them divide into p without remainder, p is also prime.\n",

    "2. For each integer, p, check if p is prime:\n",

    "    a. Iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. For each prime in this set, f, check to see if it is a factor of p:\n",
    "        i. If f divides p then p is non-prime. Continue from 2 for the next p.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. If no factors are found, p is prime. Continue to 3.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. If p is not the nth prime we have found, add it to the list of primes. Continue from 2 for the next p.\n",
