## Configuring `git-bash`

Move `bash_profile_course` to your home directory and rename it to `.bash_profile`

1. `git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"`
1. `git config --global push.default upstream`
1. `git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3`

If you use Sublime, you can do this by adding the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

1. `alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"`

## Reflections

1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
1. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
1. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
1. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
1. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
1. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
1. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
1. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
1. The current repository is converted into a git repository.
1. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
1. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
1. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
1. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
1. What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
